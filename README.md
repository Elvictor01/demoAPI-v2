Login to heroku with ```heroku login```

Set up package.json first with: ``` npm init ```

Create index.js ``` touch idex.js ```

To run, ``` node index.js ```

Install express and other dependencies:
```
# to use nodemon anywhere on computer:
npm install -g nodemon
# to install libraries in project directory
npm install mongodb express body-parser cors --save
```
Note: body-parser takes input from requests and provides ways to use them. cors allows you to access resources cross-domain. cors is not super necessary for this particular api as there will not be any frontend for now. 

Create some demo data with ``` touch node.js ``` then put some json in there.
